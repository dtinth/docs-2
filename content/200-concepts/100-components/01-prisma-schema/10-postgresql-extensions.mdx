This page introduces PostgreSQL extensions and describes how to represent extensions in your Prisma schema, how to introspect existing extensions in your database, and how to apply changes to your extensions to your database with Prisma Migrate.

<Admonition type="warning">

Support for declaring PostgreSQL extensions in your schema is available in preview for the PostgreSQL connector only in Prisma versions 4.5.0 and later.

## What are PostgreSQL extensions?

PostgreSQL allows you to extend your database functionality by installing packages known as _extensions_. For example, the `citext` extension adds a case-insensitive string data type.

To install an extension, it must already be available on the local file system of the your database server. Installing it then runs a script file that adds the new functionality.

Prisma's `postgresExtensions` preview feature allows you to represent PostgreSQL extensions in your Prisma schema. Note that specific extensions may add functionality that is not currently supported by Prisma. For example, an extension may add a type or index that is not supported by Prisma. This functionality must be implemented on a case-by-case basis and is not provided by this preview feature.

## How to enable the <inlinecode>postgresExtensions</inlinecode> preview feature

Representing PostgreSQL extensions in your Prisma schema is currently a preview feature. To enable the `postgresExtensions` preview feature, you will need to add the `postgresExtensions` feature flag to the `previewFeatures` field of the `generator` block in your Prisma schema file:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=3;add
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["postgresExtensions"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

## How to represent PostgreSQL extensions in your Prisma schema

To represent PostgreSQL extensions in your Prisma schema, add the `extensions` field to the `datasource` block of your `schema.prisma` file with an array of the extensions that you require. For example, the following schema lists the `hstore`, `pg_tgrm` and `postgis` extensions:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("TEST_DATABASE_URL")
  extensions = [hstore(schema: "myHstoreSchema"), pg_tgrm, postgis(version: "2.1")]
}
```

Each extension name in the Prisma schema can take the following optional arguments:

- `schema`: the name of the schema in which to install the extension's objects. If this argument is not specified, the current default object creation schema is used.
- `version`: the version of the extension to install. If this argument is not specified, the value given in the extension's control file is used.
- `map`: the database name of the extension. If this argument is not specified, the name of the extension in the Prisma schema must match the database name.

In the example above, the `hstore` extension uses the `myHstoreSchema` schema, and the `postgis` extension is installed with version 2.1.

The `map` argument is useful when the PostgreSQL extension you want to install has a name that is not a valid identifier in the Prisma schema. For example, the `uuid-ossp` PostgreSQL extension name is an invalid identifier because it contains a hyphen. In the following example, the extension is mapped to the valid name `uuidOssp` in the Prisma schema:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("TEST_DATABASE_URL")
  extensions = [uuidOssp(map: "uuid-ossp")]
}
```

## How to introspect PostgreSQL extensions

To [introspect](/concepts/components/introspection) PostgreSQL extensions currently installed in your database and add relevant extensions to your Prisma schema, run `npx prisma db pull`.

Many PostgreSQL extensions are not relevant to the Prisma schema. For example, some extensions are intended for database administration tasks that do not change the schema. If all these extensions were included, the list of extensions would be very long. To avoid this, Prisma maintains an allowlist of known relevant extensions. The current allowlist is the following:

- `citext`
- `postgis`
- `pg_crypto`
- `uuid-ossp`

Extensions are introspected as follows:

- The first time you introspect, all database extensions that are on the allowlist are added to your Prisma schema
- When you re-introspect, the behaviour depends on whether the extension is on the allowlist or not.
  - Extensions on the allowlist:
    - are **added** if they are in the database but not in the Prisma schema
    - are **kept** if they are in the Prisma schema and in the database
    - are **removed** if they are in the Prisma schema but not the database
  - Extensions not on the allowlist:
    - are **kept** if they are in the Prisma schema and in the database
    - are **removed** if they are in the Prisma schema but not the database

The `version` argument will not be added to the Prisma schema when you introspect.

## How to migrate PostgreSQL extensions

You can update your list of PostgreSQL extensions in your Prisma schema and apply the changes to your database with [Prisma Migrate](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate).

This works in a similar way to migration of other elements of your Prisma schema, such as models or fields. However, there are the following differences:

- If you remove an extension from your schema but it is still installed on your database, Prisma Migrate will not uninstall it from the database.
- If you add a new extension to your schema, it will only be installed if it does not already exist in the database, because the extension may already have been created manually.
